As a version control system for its source code, BlazeBlogger uses [Git](http://git-scm.com/) with a public repository located on [Gitorious](http://gitorious.org/). To download the latest development version, you can either use the following command:

```
git clone git://gitorious.org/blazeblogger/mainline.git blazeblogger
```

or if you are behind a restrictive firewall:

```
git clone http://git.gitorious.org/blazeblogger/mainline.git blazeblogger
```

Alternatively, you can explore [the repository tree](http://gitorious.org/projects/blazeblogger/repos/mainline/trees/master) directly in your browser.
