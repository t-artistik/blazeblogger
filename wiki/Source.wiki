#summary Where to get the source code.

As a version control system for its source code, BlazeBlogger uses [http://git-scm.com/ Git] with a public repository located on [http://gitorious.org/ Gitorious]. To download the latest development version, you can either use the following command:

{{{
git clone git://gitorious.org/blazeblogger/mainline.git blazeblogger
